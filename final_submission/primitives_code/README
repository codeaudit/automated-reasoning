This folder contains the SAT primitives developed by Salma Elmalaki and Mat Miller.
The library can be compiled using the makefile included in the “primitives” folder.

To compile the library use: 
make sat

==========================================
		IMPORTANT NOTE: 
==========================================
to allow for forward declaration of data structures, the header file sat_api.h contains the following lines:

/******************************************************************************
 * Forward declarations
 ******************************************************************************/
typedef struct var Var;
typedef struct literal Lit;
typedef struct clause Clause;
typedef struct sat_state_t SatState;


We note that the C2D compiler re-declares these type definitions which can lead to compilation errors/warnings. In such case, these lines needs to be commented after the static library is compiled and before it is linked in the C2D project.
